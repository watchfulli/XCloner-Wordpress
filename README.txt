== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does XCloner keep it's Database Backups? =

XCloner stores them in separate mysql dump files, inside a folder called xcloner-XXXXX inside the backup archive root path, where XXXXX is a hash number that is identical with the last 5 characters of the backup name,
so if the backup name is backup_localhost-2017-02-16_15-36-sql-1c6c6.tgz , the mysql backup file will be stored in xcloner-1c6c6/ folder.

= How do I Restore my Backup? =

XCloner provide an easy to use restore script available in the Site Backup -> Restore Backups menu, the process is being described there as well.

If the XCloner Restore option fails, you can manually restore your backup as follows:

1. extract the backup archive files to your new location
2. locate the xcloner-XXXXX folder inside your backup root folder, and look for the mysql backup in database-sql and import it through phpmyadmin
3. update your wp-config.php file to reflect the new mysql details

= How do I know which Files were include in the Backup? =

The XCloner Manager Backups Panel provides an easy utility to view each backup content files list. It also stores a copy of the archived backup files inside the xcloner-XXXXX/backup_files.csv file in an easy to read CSV format.

= Do you have a Log for the created Backup? =

Yes, if XCloner Logger option is enabled, it will store a log file inside the xcloner-XXXXX folder inside the backup archive, file is named xcloner-xxxxx.log

= What are Differentials Backups? =

Differential Backups contain files modified after a certian period of time. So each time backup runs, modified files after that period of time are added to a new Backup archive.
Compared to Incremental Backups, which contain only modified files from the previous run, they use more space but are more reliable for files restore. 
They will use considerably less space than a full backup however.

= Why Differential Backups and will you support Incremental Backups? =

The main difference comes from how reliable a backup set it. For instance, if something happens to one backup archive from the Incremental Backup set, then it is possible you will lose 
the files changes in that period of time, however if the same case happens to a Differential Backup, then the files can easily be recovered from any of the other Differential Backups. The 
storage difference between Incremental Backups and Differential Backups is not significant and considering the reliability of the Differential Set so we have decided, for now, to not implement 
further Incremental Backups.

= What would a good Backup Procedure be with Differential Backups? =

As a general rule, I would recommend setting a weekly full site backup schedule and then a daily schedule for a differential backup. You can also include a daily backup of the database in the same Differential Backup. 
Of course, schedules can be adjusted accordingly to how often you update your site, the size of it and the storage space available.
